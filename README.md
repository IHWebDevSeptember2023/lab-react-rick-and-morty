## Introduction
In this lab you will be using the Rick and Morty API to create a simple web application that displays information about the characters of the show.

## Iteration 1 - Install react-router-dom
First of all, we need to install the react-router-dom package. This package will allow us to create routes in our application.

```bash
npm install react-router-dom
```
## Iteration 2 - Create the Home page
Create a new component called `HomePage.jsx` in the `src/pages` folder. This component will be the home page of our application.
Display a welcome message and a link to the characters page `/characters`.

## Iteration 3 - Create the Characters and CharacterDetails pages
Create a new component called `CharacterList.jsx` in the `src/pages` folder. This component will be the characters page of our application. For now, they will only display a title:

```jsx
// src/pages/CharacterList.jsx
function CharacterList() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Characters</h1>
    </div>
  );
}

// src/pages/CharacterDetails.jsx
function CharacterDetails() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Character Details</h1>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Iteration 4 - Create the routes
In the App.js file, create the routes for the following paths:

- `/` - Home page
- `/characters` - Characters page with the elements of the `CharacterList` component
- `/characters/:id` - Character detail page with the elements of the `CharacterDetails` component

Now we should be able to navigate between the different pages of our application.
Let's create a navbar!

## Iteration 5 - Create the Navbar
Create a new component called `Navbar.jsx` in the `src/components` folder. This component will be the navbar of our application. It will contain a link to the home page and a link to the characters page.

Use the ```<NavLink>``` component from react-router-dom to create the links. Maybe we can add some styles to the navbar to make it look pretty ðŸ¤©


## Iteration 6 - Display the characters
Now that we have the routes and the navbar, let's display the characters on the characters page.

In the `CharacterList` component, create a state variable called `characters` and initialize it with an empty array. Then, create a `useEffect` hook that fetches the characters from the API and updates the state variable.

Remeber how to fetch data from an API? Here's a little reminder:

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  fetch('https://example.com/api')
    .then((response) => response.json()) // Transform the data into json
    .then((data) => {
      setCharacters(data); 
    });
}, []);
```

You can also use axios to fetch the data, but remember to install it first.

<details>
  <summary>API info</summary>
  <p>Check the API documentation to get the info of all characters.</p>
  <p><a href="https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation">Rick and Morty API docs</a></p>
  <p>The endpoint to get all characters is <code>https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/character</code></p>

</details>

Each character should be displayed in a card. The card should contain the following information:

- Image
- Name
- Button to go to the character detail page `/characters/:id`

## Iteration 7 - Display the character details
Now that we have the characters page, let's display the character details on the character detail page.

In the `CharacterDetails` component, create a state variable called `character` and initialize it with an empty object. Then, create a `useEffect` hook that fetches the character from the API and updates the state variable.

<details>
  <summary>API info</summary>
  <p>Check the API documentation to get the info of a single character.</p>
  <p><a href="https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation">Rick and Morty API docs</a></p>
  <p>The endpoint to get a single character is <code>https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/character/:id</code></p>
</details>

The character detail page should contain the following information:

- Image
- Name
- Status (Alive, Dead or unknown)
- Species
- Origin planet
- Number of episodes where the character appears

## BONUS! Iteration 8 - Create the SearchBar
Create a new component called `SearchBar.jsx` in the `src/components` folder. This component will be the search bar of our application. It will contain an input and a button.

The searchBar should be displayed in the CharacterList page. When the user types a name in the input the results should be filtered and displayed in the CharacterList page without reloading the page or making a new request to the API. (like we did in the nutrition lab). 

Remember what `lifting state up` means? We need pass the state as a prop to the SearchBar component. We also need to pass a function to the SearchBar component that will update the state in the CharacterList component.

<details>
  <summary>Hint</summary>
  <p>Use the <code>filter</code> method to filter the characters array.</p>
  <p>Don't forget to use <code>toLowerCase()</code> to compare the names.</p>
  <p>Create a copy of the characters array before filtering it!</p>
